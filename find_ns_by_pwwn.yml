# This playbook is a reference example complete two operations
#
# 1) find a device in NS to display by matching to Port WWN (port_name)
# 2) find a device in alias in Zoning DB to display by matching WWN
#
# wwn_to_search variable is referenced by both tasks
#
# Each operation is associated with a task to get the data
# and another to display the data.
#
# If the matching Port WWN doesn't exist in the DB, the display task
# will be "skiped". The same is true for alias display task. In other
# word, display task will only show something if a match is found.
